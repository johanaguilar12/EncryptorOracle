# Text Encryption and Decryption Project 📂

Hey everyone!
Let me introduce you to the project I've been working on an application for encrypting and decrypting texts.

## Project Description 📋

During this time, I focused on creating an application that allows us to send secret messages to each other.

## Encryption Technique 🔐

I decided to use a substitution technique to encrypt the texts. Here are my encryption "keys":

- The letter "e" is converted to "enter"
- The letter "i" is converted to "imes"
- The letter "a" is converted to "ai"
- The letter "o" is converted to "ober"
- The letter "u" is converted to "ufat"

## Implemented Functionalities 🛠️

- I created a web page with fields to insert the text we want to encrypt or decrypt. I also added options to select between these two actions.
- I implemented the necessary logic to perform encryption and decryption of the texts entered by the user.
- I added a button that allows copying the encrypted/decrypted text to the clipboard.

## Examples of Functioning 🚀

- "gato" encrypted becomes "gaitober".
- "gaitober" decrypted becomes "gato".
